# URL_analyzer
Analyzes URLs for specific keyword and diplays the number of URLs containing the keyword and then the URLs.

This code prompts the user to input a word to search for and a list of URLs. It then searches each URL's webpage content for exact matches of the word, regardless of case. Finally, it displays the number of URLs containing the word and lists those URLs.
